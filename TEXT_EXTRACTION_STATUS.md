# Text Extraction Status

Tracks what text FrontierTextHandler can extract, what remains to be done, and the technical details needed to implement each section.

Last updated: 2026-02-22

## How extraction works

FrontierTextHandler reads text from Monster Hunter Frontier game files using these extraction modes, configured in `headers.json`:

| Mode | headers.json fields | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Pointer-pair** | `begin_pointer` + `next_field_pointer` | Two pointers in the file header define the start and end of a contiguous `s32p` array. Each `s32p` is a 4-byte pointer to a null-terminated Shift-JIS string. |
| **Count-based** | `begin_pointer` + `count_pointer` | A pointer to the array start + a count field. Array length = count * 4. |
| **Struct-strided** | `begin_pointer` + `entry_count` + `entry_size` + `field_offset` | String pointers embedded at a fixed byte offset within repeated structs. |
| **Indirect count (flat)** | `begin_pointer` + `count_base_pointer` + `count_offset` | Count stored as u16/u32 at an address computed by dereferencing a base pointer + offset. Supports `pointers_per_entry` for grouped pointer arrays (e.g., s32px4) and `count_adjust` for ±1 corrections. |
| **Indirect count (strided)** | `begin_pointer` + `count_base_pointer` + `entry_size` + `field_offset` | Same indirect count mechanism, but reads from struct-strided arrays instead of flat pointer tables. |
| **Null-terminated** | `begin_pointer` + `null_terminated` | Scans pointer groups until the first pointer of a group is zero. Supports `pointers_per_entry` for grouped pointer arrays. |
| **Quest table** | `begin_pointer` + `quest_table` + `count_base_pointer` | Multi-level parser: walks a category table, follows quest struct pointers, reads text sub-pointers per quest. All 8 strings per quest are joined with `<join>` tags. |

All files are auto-decrypted (ECD/EXF) and auto-decompressed (JPK/JKR) before parsing.

### Not yet extracted

All documented text fields in mhfdat.bin are now extracted.

Note on `important_nums`: Several counts are stored as `u16` values at offsets within the data block pointed to by header offset 0x010. The exact offset depends on game version (Wii U: `+0x272` range, PC G10-ZZ: `+0x350` range). The indirect-count extraction mode reads these automatically.

Pattern: none. Header layout reverse-engineered by scanning header pointers for pointer tables that target the main Shift-JIS string region at 0x0001A0–0x00C62F (~1,559 unique strings).

### Extracted

| `gao/skill_text` | 0x124 | Felyne skill descriptions + English skill names — 238 entries: [0..1] EN headers ("None", "Disables wind pressure."), [2..55] 54 JP skill effect descriptions (previously the "orphan 0x13EC8" region — reachable here as entries [2..55]), [56..237] 182 EN skill names | struct-strided (fixed 238, size 4, field 0) |
| `gao/skill_names_zenith` | 0x12C | English Zenith/Myriad Felyne skill names — 9 entries (Status Immunity, No Stamin Depletion, Elemental Attack Up, Affinity Up, Divine Protection, Goddess' Embrace, …) | struct-strided (fixed 9, size 4, field 0) |

**2,109 strings** extracted across 15 header-rooted tables: 2×257 armor names, 257 weapon names, 514 armor descriptions, 257 weapon descriptions, 8×40 Felyne partner dialogue templates, 238 Felyne skill description / English name entries at 0x124, and 9 Zenith Felyne skill names at 0x12C.

Layout notes:
- `armor_helm` and `weapon_names` use fixed entry_count because an ASCII build-date string ("YYYY/MM/DD") is stored between the table end and its 0 terminator, which breaks null-terminated scanning.
- `armor_desc` and `weapon_desc` use a flat s32p array where each description is 3 string pointers followed by a 0 terminator (4 ptrs per group). Row 0 of each table is an English fallback ("Nothing equipped." / "None") pointing into a second English text region at `0x34000`-`0x35765`.
- Two distinct text regions exist: Japanese at `0x0001A0`-`0x00C62F` (~1,559 unique strings) and English at `0x034000`-`0x035765`.

### Not yet extracted

| Pointer | Evidence | Est. strings | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| 0x040 | header → 0x21FE0, situational/event dialogue indirection table | ~20 readable | Extremely sparse 64+ word region mostly filled with null entries interleaved with string pointers that land **mid Shift-JIS character** (e.g. `0x2102 → 'W！\n…'`, `0x230A → 'ｯ型が崩れるのが…'`). Evidence that the game composes dialogue at runtime from sub-string fragments rather than storing complete pointers. Needs struct field-level RE plus a template/composition engine to reconstitute full sentences; not extractable as flat s32p. |
| nested 0xCC/0xD4/0xDC | `count=8` at 0x0C8/0x0D0/0x0D8, then 3-level `(count, ptr)` trees at 0x19380 / 0x15F80 / 0x15140 | ~16 unique fragments (not ~250) | Tree walk confirmed: outer array of 8 × (u32 count, u32 ptr) → middle array of *count* × (u32 count, u32 ptr) → leaf array of *count* × s32p. Walking all three trees yields only ~16 unique readable strings, and the rest of the leaf pointers land mid Shift-JIS character (same compositional tokenization as 0x040). Interpretation: these are the per-skill **effect formula tables** that the game uses to build the skill description shown in `gao/skill_text` at runtime — each leaf entry glues a fragment like `耐性値が上昇する。` to a numeric prefix to produce "X resistance rises." etc. The translator-usable strings are already captured via `gao/skill_text`; these tables carry no additional unique translatable content. Implementing a recursive walker is feasible but not worthwhile for translation output. |
| orphan 0x13EC8 | 54 Felyne JP skill effect descriptions | — | **Resolved.** Not actually orphan: header pointer `0x124 → 0x13EC0` references a 238-entry s32p table that contains these 54 JP descriptions as entries [2..55]. Now fully extracted via `gao/skill_text`. |

Remaining unextracted text in mhfgao.bin: **~20 readable fragments in the 0x040 situational-dialogue region**, blocked on field-level RE of the composition engine. The 0xCC/0xD4/0xDC nested trees carry no additional translatable strings beyond fragment tokens already represented by `gao/skill_text`.

## Other game files

## mhfsqd.bin — Squad / NPC partner data

Source: `client/pc/dat/mhfsqd.bin` (ECD-encrypted + JKR-compressed; decrypted+decompressed size 16,036 B)
Pattern: none. Greenfield reverse-engineered by scanning the 15 u32 pointers at 0x00-0x38 for struct-strided tables whose embedded string pointer fields target the flat Shift-JIS blob at 0x40-0x14C0 (223 null-terminated strings).

### Extracted

| xpath | Pointer | Content | Mode |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| `sqd/npc_names` | 0x28 | NPC partner names (Aaron, Bart, Calvin, Tania, ...) — 43 entries | struct-strided (size 8, field 0) |

| `sqd/skill_quest_label` | 0x10 | Skill quest-count labels ("Usable N times per quest") — 80 entries | struct-strided (size 12, field 4) |
| `sqd/header_labels` | 0x38 | Header / placeholder labels (point suppression, point reset) — 3 entries | struct-strided (size 12, field 4) |

**190 strings** extracted across 6 header-rooted struct-strided tables. All tables are bounded exactly by the next header pointer (each header slot at 0x00-0x38 delimits one struct section).

### Not yet extracted

Investigation (2026-04-06) revised the remaining-string estimate sharply downward. Inspecting the two candidate tables at runtime:
- Header 0x38 -> 0x14E0 (0x30 B, 12 u32): 12-byte stride `(index, name_ptr, template_ptr)` with only 3 populated rows. Already fully extracted by `sqd/header_labels` — the remaining cells are 1 shared effect template (`効果\n…`) plus null padding. **0 new strings.**
- Header 0x34 -> 0x1510 (16 B): flag words only, no strings.
- Header 0x30 -> 0x1520 (0x120 B, 72 u32): pointer-to-pointer network whose leaf values are of the form `0x0001019c` — **skill IDs, not file offsets** (they exceed the 0x3EA4 file size). Cross-references to the skill table already extracted elsewhere. Entries that do point into 0x27A0-0x27B4 land on an all-null region in this file version. **0 new strings.**
- Headers 0x00/0x04/0x08/0x0C/0x1C/0x20/0x2C point to non-string data (floats, indices, tables of struct IDs).

Net remaining translator-useful strings in sqd: **~0**. The earlier ~33 estimate was wrong — it counted ID cross-references and layout padding as strings.

## mhfrcc.bin — Reception / event info

Source: `client/pc/dat/mhfrcc.bin` (ECD-encrypted + JKR-compressed; decrypted+decompressed size 2,556 B).
Pattern: none. Greenfield reverse-engineered by scanning decrypted bytes for Shift-JIS runs and cross-referencing u32 values to candidate string pointers.

### Extracted

| xpath | Pointer | Content | Mode |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| `rcc/events_en` | 0x08 | English event-info strings (Pallone Grand Voyage, Hunter Fest, Hunting Competition, ...) — 7 entries | struct-strided (fixed 7, size 4, field 0) |
| `rcc/events_full` | 0x00 | Event info multi-field struct table at 0x5c0: 7 rows × 36-byte stride with up to 4 string ptr fields per row (+0x14 title / +0x18 description / +0x1C / +0x20). Captures JP descriptions (パローネ大航祭, 極限征伐戦, 天廊遠征録), `Guild Conquest is underway!`, and the `残り時間` template — 28 entries | struct-strided (multi-field [20,24,28,32]) |

Re-investigation on 2026-04-06 confirmed the region is a uniform 36-byte stride (not variable), bounded exactly by header 0x00=0x5c0 and header 0x04=7. Handled by upgrading `struct-strided` to support multi-field `field_offset` (int or list[int]) in `pointer_tables.py`.

### Not yet extracted

No remaining translator-useful strings in the 0x5c0-0x6c0 region — the earlier ~27-string estimate was wrong. Several slots in `events_full` are `−` placeholders (rows that define only title+description), which is expected game data, not missing coverage.

## mhfmsx.bin — Mezeporta Festa

Source: `client/pc/dat/mhfmsx.bin` (ECD-encrypted + JKR-compressed; decrypted+decompressed size 15,072 B).
Pattern: none. Greenfield reverse-engineered by locating the only readable Shift-JIS block (0x80-0xf8) and walking the nearest backing struct table.

### Extracted

| xpath | Base | Content | Mode |
|-------|------|---------|------|
| `msx/item_name` | 0x2abc (literal) | Festa item names: 輝く杯, 宝飾剣, 古書物, 小箱, 燭台 + 12 `----` placeholder slots — 17 entries | struct-strided literal_base (size 0x24, field 0) |
| `msx/item_effect` | 0x2abc (literal) | Festa item effects: 踏破報酬枠追加, 踏破報酬抽選確率アップ, TRP増加, 狩人祭効果発動, パローネ大航祭効果発動 + placeholders — 17 entries | struct-strided literal_base (size 0x24, field 4) |

10 real Japanese strings (5 names + 5 effects) recovered out of 34 struct slots in this section. A new `literal_base: true` flag on the struct-strided extraction mode was added to `pointer_tables.py` so that the struct base address (0x2abc) can be specified directly when no header u32 happens to hold it.

### Not yet extracted

Any additional localized strings referenced from sibling struct tables elsewhere in mhfmsx.bin. Color labels (赤, 青, 黄) at ~0x2d30 sit in a different layout and are not currently exposed.

### Recommended next steps (by effort/impact ratio)

1. **mhfgao.bin nested tables** — implement a recursive (count, ptr) tree walker for the structures at header 0x0C8/0x0D0/0x0D8 to surface the remaining Felyne skill descriptions
2. **mhfrcc.bin variable-stride struct region** — write a dedicated walker for the 0x5c0-0x6c0 event-info structs to recover the remaining 27 Japanese announcement strings
